So this happened — I got featured in Elastic's brand new **Top Down** series, and turns out I'm the very first one! Pretty surreal, honestly.

## What's Top Down?

It's a new series where Elastic peeks into the workspaces (and heads) of folks who work here. Think of it as a "how do you actually get stuff done?" kind of thing — what's on your desk, what keeps you focused, what do you do when you're not coding.

## What We Talked About

Jeanetta Clement wrote the piece, titled *"Where Creativity and Code Collide"* (love that title). We covered a bunch of stuff:

- **The setup** — my Mac, my 27-inch display, and why I literally cannot function without my workspace
- **Pomodoro life** — 25 minutes on, 5 minutes off. It works, I swear.
- **ElasticGPT** — the internal AI tool I help lead. Built for Elasticians, by Elasticians. Over 80,000 conversations and counting.
- **Music** — I play five instruments (self-taught, for better or worse). It's meditation for me.
- **Building in public** — why I think sharing your work openly is the way to go

We also got into the childhood stuff — like how I used to take apart every electronic device my dad brought home. He was not pleased. But hey, look where it led.

Big thanks to Jeanetta and the Elastic team for putting this together. It's cool to be part of a company that actually cares about the people behind the work.
